Hello,

A big thank-you to Nick Rusnov (http://nick.industrialmeats.com/) for
contributing an awesome set of icons created with InkScape.

I have no release schedule for version 0.1 yet.  Definitely by the end
of May 2005, hopefully earlier.  My plan is to put up a release as soon
as I feel the photo storage mechanism and database schema are stable.


Cheers.
